**Vanya and UX/UI Poem**

In the world of design, where visions unfold,
Vanya stood tall, creative and bold.
With Figma as his canvas, and stories yet untold,
He painted user journeys, both new and old.

Macbook in hand, sleek and so fine,
It powered his dreams, line by line.
For Vanya knew well, the delicate line,
Between a user's need and a design that's divine.

Figma's vectors and frames danced at his behest,
Each prototype and layout, better than the rest.
With colors and gradients, he was simply the best,
Crafting interfaces that stood every test.

On his Macbook's screen, ideas came to life,
Minimizing confusion, reducing the strife.
For in Vanya's world, devoid of rife,
UX/UI was more than design, it was life.

From mobile to desktop, his designs did gleam,
Guided by user stories and a digital dream.
Vanya, with Figma and Macbook, the ultimate team,
Creating experiences that made users beam.
