5. **The Augean Stables of Data Cleansing**: Cleaning vast amounts of data, akin to Hercules cleaning the immense stables.

6. **The Stymphalian Birds of Bug Squashing**: Targeting and fixing a multitude of bugs in the software.

7. **The Cretan Bull of Performance Optimization**: Taming the wild bull of software performance, making it run smoothly and efficiently.

8. **The Mares of Diomedes of Integration Challenges**: Taming the wild mares of software integration, ensuring disparate systems work harmoniously.

9. **The Belt of Hippolyta of Client Expectations**: Achieving the difficult task of meeting or exceeding client expectations.

10. **The Cattle of Geryon of Multi-Platform Support**: Managing the herd of different platforms and ensuring compatibility across all.

11. **The Apples of the Hesperides of Cutting-Edge Technology**: Seeking the golden apples of the latest and greatest in technology.

12. **The Capture of Cerberus of Final Deployment**: The ultimate challenge of deploying the final product, ensuring it's secure, robust, and user-friendly.
