**Vadim and OpenBSD Poem**

In the realm of code, where zeros intertwine,
Vadim, the programmer, sought a design,
OpenBSD at his side, pure and unrefined,
Together they tread, their goals aligned.

Amidst the chaos of bytes and bits,
Vadim found solace in OpenBSD's wits,
With security and simplicity, no gimmicks or glitz,
A foundation so strong, where his code perfectly fits.

But a challenge arose, as challenges do,
C++ called to him, its allure ever new,
With classes and objects, and templates too,
Vadim embraced it, his expertise grew.

OpenBSD's fortress, with C++'s might,
Vadim's code danced, light as a kite,
For in this union, he found pure delight,
Crafting solutions, both swift and tight.

So, in the annals of code and decree,
Vadim's legacy with OpenBSD and C++ will be,
A testament to passion, skill, and esprit,
Forever remembered, as long as bytes shall be.
